        <p class="content-text">When COVID first broke out and all public gatherings were ended, it was difficult to find ways to entertain yourself under forced quarentining. As a musician, Thursday nights were always a time I looked forward to going out and meeting up with fellow musicians to play a few sets.As the lockdown progressed, I took the opportunity to learn a new instrument, and conceived the idea of recording music just for fun.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Because these files typically took up a lot of space and access was limited, I started to work on a website to store the music on as well, to be hosted at a point in the future. This way, I could have the recordings available if I ever wanted to publish the website.</p>
        <p class="content-text">As we begin to open back up and public gatherings begin to gain traction, the urge to record and catalog continues to exist; not just as a way to pass the time, but also as a way to save recordings for potential future projects or just to have something to pass down to posterity.</p>
