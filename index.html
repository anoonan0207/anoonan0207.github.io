        </div>
        <p>I am a Certified Public Accountant with experience in public accounting, financial reporting, corporate accounting, record-keeping and finance. I attended DePaul University here in Chicago, Illinois and received my bachelors degrees in accounting and finance. I am currently pursuing a masters degree in investment management and financial analysis at Creighton University part-time online.</p>
        <p>Although it's been a while since I've worked with coding and website building, I find it fascinating how what is seen online is just a manifestation of a coding language. A professor of mine once said that "accounting is the language of business," and if that is the case, then the myriad coding languages are the languages of the future. In the business field, there is a strong push for knowledge of systems and technological literacy, but that is barely scraping the surface of what lies below.</p>
        <p>My passions in technology grew from html/website design and later expanded into the realm of VBA and working with and building macros. Outside of technology, I play and record music, typically traditional Irish. I took lessons with the Irish Music School of Chicago and later frequented sessions, playing with prominent musicians in the Chicago circle. When COVID broke out and we were no longer allowed to meet, I conceived the idea to dive deeper into and record Irish music to occupy myself until COVID ended. An interesting issue I started to run into was the degredation of the quality of sound from the recordings. It has since become a personal project of mine to try to improve the quality of the recordings.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work at SP+ in their corporate accounting and financial reporting department. In addition to handling the regulatory filings of SP+ and certain accounting areas, my team and I engage in process improvement intiatives surrounding systems use and technology to better parse through transactions recorded in the accounting system.</p>
